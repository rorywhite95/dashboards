# Insights
There is a general decline in turnover from March to October, which could be attributed to greater online spending during the third COVID-19 lockdown in April 2021 and then consequent decrease.

There are large spikes in turnover across the eight-month period on specific days, the most significant of these being the 11th April and 30th June. The 11th April spike coincides closely with the announcement of the third French lockdown, while this same lockdown was lifted on 30th June. This could explain these spikes, as people increase the amount of products ordered online in the wake of another lockdown, or perhaps increase their spending and consumption following its termination.

There are slight differences in average turnover between different days of the week, ranging from 76.5 on Mondays to 72 on Saturdays.
