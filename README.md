# Insights
There is a general decline in turnover from March to October, which could be attributed to greater online spending during the third COVID-19 lockdown in April 2021 and then consequent decrease.

There are large spikes in turnover across the eight-month period on specific days, the most significant of these being the 11th April and 30th June. The 11th April spike is around the time of the announcement of a third French lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while this same lockdown was lifted on 30th June. This might explain such spikes, as people increase the amount of products ordered online in the wake of another lockdown, or might increase their spending following its termination.
